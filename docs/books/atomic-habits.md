> Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones

Author: [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).

## Chapter 1

The author described change is slow very well by using ice cube as the example. Imagine the ice cube is on the table with temperature of 25 degrees. No change on the ice cube and temperature is slowly increasing by 1 degree. Nothing happens at 26 degrees. 27 degrees, 28, 29, 30, 31 and still nothing happens. Until 32 degree, the ice cube is begins to melt. As you can see 1 degree shift, it doesn't show any difference, but until it reaches to a point where it will unlock a huge change. In short, to building a good habit, it takes time.

> There is a phrase, "Roman wasn't built in a day"

- Forgot about goals, focus on systems instead for better results.
- Habits are like the atoms of our live.
- Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long term.
- Habits are a double-edged sword. They can **work for** or **against** you.
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you reach a certain threshold.
