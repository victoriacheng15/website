What is [type challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges)? It is a project developed and maintained by Anthony Fu.

If you are learning JavaScript, you may see or hear about TypeScript. It is likely you already know that, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. In short, it is the JavaScript with a type-checking system. When I looked through the job board on LinkedIn, I often see TypeScript on the `must to have` or `nice to have` list.

The challenges will split into 5 categories:

- warm-up
- easy
- medium
- hard
- extreme

The goal of type challenges:

- better understand how the type system works
- write your own utilities

Check out `Warm-up` for general format.
