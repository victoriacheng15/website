What is [type challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges)? It is a project developed and maintained by Anthony Fu.

If you are learning JavaScript, you may see or hear about TypeScript. It is likely you already know that, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. In short, it is the JavaScript with a type-checking system. When I looked through the job board on LinkedIn, I often see TypeScript on the `must to have` or `nice to have` list.

The challenges will split into 5 categories:

- warm-up
- easy
- medium
- hard
- extreme

The goal of type challenges:

- better understand how the type system works
- write your own utilities

## Challenge Format

_This is the general format for describing a Type Challenge: first, provide a description of the problem. Then, present the solution to the problem, including any relevant resource links or notes._

Hello, World! (this will be the heading)

In Type Challenges, we use the type system itself to do the assertion.

For this challenge, you will need to change the following code to make the tests pass (no type check errors).
