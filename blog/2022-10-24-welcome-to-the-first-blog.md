Welcome to the first blog for this site!! Mark the day! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠðŸ¥³

<!--truncate-->

I was looking for a way to have my blogs and portfolio site into one ONE PLACE without having to use database to store my blogs. I found there are two that I like and they are Astro and Docusaurus. Both are good in my opinion since I have tried to build on both and see which one fits my need the most. In the end, I decided on Docusaurus since the logo is too cute not to choose them. I am kidding! I found Docusaurus is more easier to set up and the learning curve is not too steep.

For now, the site is not 100% completely done. BUT BUT BUT since when something is not 100% done?? ðŸ˜† Anyway, I am looking forward to improve this site little by little over time!
