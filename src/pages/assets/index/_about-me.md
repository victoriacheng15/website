Hi! I'm Victoria, a software developer and a blogger. I'm passionate about providing better user experiences for websites and apps. I have worked as a packaging engineer for the past several years, but found myself passionless by what I do lately. So I took some time to educate myself about programming in 2021.

Why programming/software development? Programming/software offer endless possibilities, which is awesome. I had a problem of deciding what to do and went on aimless direction for a few months. Until I decided on web development. From there, I learned about JavaScript and its ecosystem. Also, write blogs to share what I learned about software development.

If you are interested in know more about me, I had wrote a blog
