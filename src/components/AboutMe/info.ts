I have worked as a packaging engineer for the past several years, but found myself passionless by what I do lately. So I took some time to educate myself about programming in 2021.";

Until I decided on web development. From there, I learned about JavaScript and its ecosystem. Also, write blogs to share what I learned about software development.";
